In order to run this: 
make modules
sudo insmod q8Driv.ko
dmesg
find the “Major Number” from the dmesg log (probably it is 248)
sudo mknod /dev/q8 c 248 0 (248 should be replaced with the major number from previous step)

Once the module is inserted into the kernel we can run the following to control the values.

gcc Q8user-test.c -o Q8user-test
sudo ./Quser-test
